# Py-Harris-Corner-Detection
This is a simple image-processing tool that was used to identify corners of images using the Harris Corner Detection method which you can learn about here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Corner_Detector

# What does this do?
Simply returns a Pandas Dataframe that can be used for a image dataset. I've also included a debug mode which shows what points have been identified.

# Future Plans
- Going to add a way to disable and enable the "waitkey" ability.
